yt-dlp wrapper for funsies.
chatgpt assisted.
i include the packed exe (no dependencies needed i think, file an issue here if something goes wrong (dependency related)) and the source file, the .py one.
tested on a 1920x1080 laptop screen.
opens a 560x640 window.
requires ttkbootstrap (for anyone who decides to dig in the source file).
Feel free to skid this one too :)

virustotal result (false positives i suppose):
